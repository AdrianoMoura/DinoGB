# ü¶ñ Chrome Dino Game - Game Boy Edition

This is my personal take on the **Chrome Dino Game**, recreated for the **Game Boy**! I did this project to challenge myself and learn more about developing for this iconic handheld console using the [GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit)](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020).

## üìú About

We‚Äôve all seen (and probably played) the dinosaur game in Google Chrome when the internet goes down. I thought it would be a good project to port, the simple mechanics was a good fit to develop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Am I Doing This?

I wanted to challenge myself by making it. Learning the ins and outs of the GBDK, working with sprites, sound, and limited hardware is both fun and rewarding. This project is a personal journey into retro game development, and I‚Äôm sharing it in case it inspires someone else to dive into Game Boy dev too!


## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Try It Out
If you just want to try it just download the [dino.gb](https://github.com/AdrianoMoura/DinoGB/build/dino.gb) file.

If you want to compile the project first you gonna need to download the [GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit)](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and setup the local environment to run it.

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/AdrianoMoura/DinoGB
cd DinoGB
```

I already left a .bat file with the command to build on Windows, just run it

```
make.bat
```

Get the dino.gb from the build folder and try it on your favorite emulator or using a EverDrive to try it on the original hardware
